<h2>Bloodmoon</h2>
<h3><strong>Tools: </strong>Affinity Designer, Illustrator<br><strong>Role in team: </strong>UI and wireframes<br><strong>2021</strong></h3>
<p>This project was part of a course I took at Ume√• university. The goal was to conceptualize a campaign towards destigmatizing menstruation and the design was to include the Pantone color "Period". The concept that my team came up with ended up being Bloodmoon, which partly consisted of a social gamification based on the old myth that menstrual cycles can sync with the people one surrounds oneself with, as well as the lunar phases. Our concept also included a website which would host educational content surrounding menstruation, as well as a forum where users could talk about their experiences.</p>

<h2>Main takeaway</h2>
<p>This was a fun project were I had to put my creative muscles to work. It also took place during the midst of the covid-19 pandemic, which led the project to become a remote collaboration were we often worked synchronously. This taught me a lot about the common challanges with remote work, but also how to get through these and still end up being productive.</p>
