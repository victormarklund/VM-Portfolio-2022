                    <p class="body1 left">This project aimed to build a community and a creative space, where people from all over the world could meet, learn and grow together. Lemon Juice Collective served as one of my hobby projects during my studies, and with the help of two of my good friends, I formed a little team. The goal of this team was to plan and host events for the community to participate in, as well as to futher improve the digital space where we hung out.</p>
                    <p class="body1 left">The main platform for this project ended up being a Discord server where community members could chat, post projects for feedback, spam memes, etc.</p>

                    <p class="body1 left">The main event that was hosted on the server was Word of the Week. This challange provided the members with a prompt which they were to use as inspiration for a piece of artwork. The artwork could be anything they wanted and the level of ambition didn't matter. The goal was to inspire people to just make something. This prompt usually came served with a matching visual in order to increase the members motivation and I was in charge of creating these. Some examples ended up looking something like this...</p>

                    <h2>Main takeaway</h2>
                    <p class="body1 left">This project eventually ended in late 2021 when I shifted focus onto other endeavours. It taught me a lot about the weight of progressive testing in order to get users onboard with your ideas. It also gave me the hard lesson that even though your idea might seem great, it might not work at all in the real world.</p>
